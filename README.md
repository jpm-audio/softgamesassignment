# jPm - Softgames Assignment

Game Developer Assignment for Softgames created by Jesús Pérez de Miguel <jesus@perezdemiguel.com>

## Comments

### Pixi.js Version: 8.6.1

The assignment specifies v7, but I've been using v8 for months and I'd rather not spend time remembering the differences between versions. So I've decided to use v8 which I'm currently more familiar with.

## Run

To play the game in local environment just run

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Build

To create a new build of the game run

```bash
  npm run build
```
